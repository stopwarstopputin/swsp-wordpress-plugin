# Stop War! Stop Putin! WordPress Plugin

A WordPress Plugin allowing you to block all visitors from Russia and display a custom message to stand up against Putin and to stop war.


## Why did we release a Stop War! Stop Putin! WordPress Plugin?

Like a lot op people in the world, we were very much shocked when Russia started the war against Ukraine.  

It was also depressing to see how slow western governments were acting to resolve the conflict and agree on sanctions and we felt that there was little we could do until we saw the people in Russia standing up in the streets to protest.

First there were few protestors, than the numbers increased as Russians realized more and more that Wladmir Putin has become a war criminal ruining the country. 

We now believe that the internal pressure from Russians on Putin and the Russian government is the most promising way to end war.

This can only happen when more and more Russians feels sanctions in everyday life. 

That's why we created the Stop War! Stop Putin! WordPress Plugin which allows everyone who runs a WordPress blog to impose sanctions on Russia by blocking Visitors from Russian IP addresses from their content and fuel the protests.

The aim of this WordPress Plugin is to give you the power to impose your very own sanctions against Russia and spread your statement to stop war and stop Putin.


## What does the Stop War! Stop Putin! WordPress Plugin do?

When you have installed and activated the Stop War! Stop Putin! WordPress Plugin on your WordPress blog, it will allow you to block all visitors coming from IP Addresses associated with the Russian Federation instead of showing your website's regular content. 

You can choose in the settings if you want your WordPress website to display a 403 error, redirect to another URL or show a specific, customizable WordPress page to explain why you sanctioned the access and to encourage your Russian visitors to take actions.
