# swsp-wordpress-plugin

This WordPress Plugin allows you to block all visitors from Russia and display a custom message to turn against Putin to stop war instead.

We were very much shocked by the war of Russia against Ukraine and how slowly our governments agreed on sanctions.

It was good seeing that the people in Russia took things in their own hands and started demonstrations in St. Petersberg and other major cities. The internal pressure from Russia's citizens is what we believe to be the strongest influence on Putin and the Russian government which cannot be ignored forever.

To allow everyone who runs an own WordPress blog/website to start own sanctions against Russia, we have quickly put together the "Stop War, Stop Putin" WordPress plugin (aka swsp). Once installed on your WordPress website, it will block the entire Russian Federation IP Ranges and display either an error message or a custom message to visitors from Russia, where you can encourage them to step up and protest.

We are aware that blocking all Russian IP addresses is quite a drastic measure and the primary intent of this WordPress plugin is create awareness amongst Russians how connected our world is and to signal that now is the time to raise their voice. It is NOT intended to harm the Russian population on an ongoing basis.

Now it's your choice: Will you help to Stop War and Stop Putin with the SWSP WordPress Plugin?
